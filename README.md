# GoProgramming
Here is where I will be practising and uploading all my updates in Golang

Why should you learn go? What's unique and good about the Go language?
Advantages of Go:
1. Code runs fast
2. Garbage collection - Similar languages that run fast like Go does, do not use a garbage collector. So this is a really useful feature
3. Simpler obejcts - Go is essentially object oriented, but it has this concept of objects, the object orientation is a little simplified as compared to other languages.
4. Concurrency is efficient
